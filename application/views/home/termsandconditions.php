                    Description of Rental Offer

                    </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item">The Rental Offers describe the objects, products and goods that are currently on offer for rent. They can only include the words, documents and images which the member decides to put online. Members are responsible for their Content, especially with regards to any intellectual property claims which might be made by a third party. All the objects, products, goods, and spaces must be placed in the appropriate category. Any Member, including you, who posts a Rental Offer (a "Giver") is solely responsible for ensuring proper category choices for their rental offers. Placement of an offer in a particular category by a Giver can in no instance be interpreted as a guarantee on Rentooz's part regarding the origin and authenticity of said rental object. A Giver must have either all ownership rights on an object, or all rights allowing them to put the object they have listed up for rent. Any material terms and conditions of a Rental Offer, including, but not limited to, cost of rental, security deposit, delivery, maintenance fees, or any additional fees, representations or warranties must be clearly indicated in the Rental Offer. Further, if any Rental Agreement is to be proposed by the Giver it must be attached to the Rental Offer.  Things that count as contact information include, but are not limited to, the physical location of the Item, the Giver’s physical address, fax, telephone number, mailing address email address, or any other way to contact the Giver outside of the Rentooz interface. Rentooz recommends that Givers obtain appropriate insurance for their Rental Offers. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Offer and any property relating to your offering carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Borrowers (and the individuals the Borrower invites to participate in the service or activity, if applicable) while participating in the service or activity you sponsor.</p>

If you, as a Giver, choose to enter into a transaction with a Giver for the booking of a Listing, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Giver and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Listing imposed by the Giver. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Rentooz, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, and Rentooz is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.

                    <p class="list-group-item">Rentooz does not itself offer any rental services. The site is an online marketplace only, designed for the unique purpose of putting people who want to rent items and spaces in touch with people who have items and spaces to rent. In additional to it, the site shall handle the transfer of the rent money(not involving any advance payments or security deposits as such) between the Giver and the Borrower. Rentooz cannot thus be considered part of the Rental Agreement between members of the Site. Rentooz exercises no control over the quality, safety or legality of Items listed, or over the truthfulness or accuracy of the Rental Offers, or over the ability of Givers to rent the Items listed or over the ability of the Borrower to rent or pay for the rental of any Items. We do not guarantee that the Parties will complete any or all terms of the transaction. Any security deposits or guarantees required by the Giver in whatever form, remains the sole responsibility of the Borrower/Renter and Giver. Rentooz is not responsible for the collection, retention, or refunding of any security deposit, for the control of the exact identity of the Giver and the Borrower. Accordingly, Rentooz recommends that you seek professional advice when preparing a Rental Agreement.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item">The Giver is free to accept or deny any Rental Request. However, once the Giver has accepted the Reservation Request, the Giver and the Proposed Borrower agree that the proposed terms of the transaction, including any Rental Agreement is binding (subject to any conditions laid out in the Rental Agreement, such as inspection upon delivery.) Rentooz is not responsible for any "double booking" by a Giver or the late return of an Item by a Borrower. The transfer of goldcoins and its conversion to earnings shall stop exactly when the renting period is stopped as decided by the renter and the borrower. Rentooz is not responsible for the condition of the Items posted in a Rental Offer. As such, Rentooz highly recommends that the Proposed Borrower inspect the Item properly and cancel the deal on the very first day of the renting period. One day after the deal begins, the borrower shall not be able to cancel the deal and shall have to pay the entire renting amount.</p>
