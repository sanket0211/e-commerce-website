                                                Renting or on demand access of items makes life easy for anyone and everyone who is looking for getting things done without spending much. For example bicycle, professional camera, house hold stuff, tool kits, drill machine, sports equipment etc.

                                                Nowadays, renting houses is just a click away but other items are not a part of them. So instead of buying a new one why not to take on rent from some one near by, May be within your society or community. There is a high chance than someone might be owning that item already and you are not aware of that. So why not to take that item on rent.
